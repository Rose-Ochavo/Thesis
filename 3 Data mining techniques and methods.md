The terms "techniques" and "methods" are often used interchangeably, but in certain contexts, they can have slightly different connotations. Here's a general distinction:

**Techniques:**
- Techniques typically refer to a set of procedures, processes, or approaches used to accomplish a specific task or goal. They are often associated with practical, hands-on, or applied aspects of a field.
- Techniques can involve the application of methods or tools to achieve a desired outcome.
- They are often domain-specific and may be specialized approaches within a broader field.

**Methods:**
- Methods are more general and refer to systematic, organized procedures or approaches for conducting research, analysis, or problem-solving across various fields.
- Methods can encompass a range of techniques and may involve the selection and application of specific tools, algorithms, or processes.
- They often provide a framework or systematic structure for approaching a problem or conducting research.

In summary, techniques are usually specific applications or practices within a field, while methods encompass a broader framework for systematic problem-solving or research. In many cases, the distinction between the two terms can be subtle, and they may be used interchangeably, especially in casual language. However, in academic and technical contexts, the choice of terminology may depend on the level of specificity and generality being conveyed.
