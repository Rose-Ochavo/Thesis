Sure! Imagine you want to build a sandcastle at the beach. 

A "method" is like having a plan for building the sandcastle. It tells you the steps you need to follow, like making a big mound of sand and then shaping it into a castle shape.

A "technique" is like a special way of doing things while building the sandcastle. For example, using a bucket to make a tower or a seashell to decorate it. These are specific tricks or ways to do things within your sandcastle-building plan.

So, a method is your overall plan, and techniques are the little tricks or special ways you use to make your sandcastle look cool.
