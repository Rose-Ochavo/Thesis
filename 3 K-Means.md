`K-Means`: K-means is a specific clustering algorithm within the clustering category. It's a widely used algorithm that falls under the umbrella of unsupervised machine learning. K-means is used to partition a dataset into 'k' clusters, where 'k' is a predefined number chosen by the user. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updates the centroids until convergence.
