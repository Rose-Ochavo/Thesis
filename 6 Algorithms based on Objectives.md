Based on your specific objectives, using both K-means clustering and association rule mining in your research paper on consumer buying behavior of motorcycle parts and accessories makes sense. Here's how each objective aligns with these techniques:

1. **To create a data mining model for consumer buying behavior:**
   - K-means clustering can help you create segments or clusters of consumers based on their buying behavior. This can be useful in understanding the different consumer groups and their preferences.
   - Association rule mining can help you discover patterns in consumer purchases, revealing which items are frequently bought together. This can contribute to building a predictive model for consumer behavior.

2. **To assess the effectiveness of the data mining model:**
   - By using both techniques, you can evaluate the effectiveness of your data mining model from different angles. K-means clustering can assess the model's ability to segment consumers accurately, while association rule mining can evaluate how well the model identifies purchasing patterns.

3. **To provide insights for consumer buying behavior of motorcycle parts and accessories:**
   - K-means clustering can provide insights into the characteristics of different consumer segments, helping you understand the demographics, preferences, and needs of various customer groups.
   - Association rule mining can offer insights into the relationships between products, such as which motorcycle parts or accessories are often purchased together. This information can be valuable for marketing strategies and inventory management.

In summary, using both K-means clustering and association rule mining aligns well with your research objectives. They can help you create a comprehensive data mining model, assess its effectiveness, and provide valuable insights into consumer buying behavior in the context of motorcycle parts and accessories. Be sure to explain how each technique contributes to achieving these objectives in your research paper.
