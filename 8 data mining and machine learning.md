Actually, your statement is not entirely accurate. Data mining and machine learning are related fields, but they are not the same, and their focuses and objectives differ.

1. **Data Mining**: Data mining is the process of discovering patterns, relationships, and insights in large datasets. It involves extracting valuable information and knowledge from data. Data mining techniques can include clustering, classification, association rule mining, and anomaly detection. While data mining can involve the development of algorithms and models, its primary goal is to find hidden patterns and knowledge in data rather than making predictions. It is often used for exploratory data analysis and knowledge discovery.

2. **Machine Learning**: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions. Machine learning algorithms are designed to improve their performance on a specific task through experience (data). The primary objective of machine learning is to create predictive models or decision-making systems. It encompasses various techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

In summary, data mining is more about discovering patterns and knowledge in data, while machine learning is about building predictive models and decision-making systems using data. They share some common techniques and tools, but their goals and emphases are different.
