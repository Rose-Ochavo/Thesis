Association rule mining is different from clustering, and it does involve specific algorithms. While clustering aims to group similar data points into clusters based on their inherent similarity, association rule mining aims to discover relationships and patterns between items or attributes within a dataset. Here are some key differences:

1. **Objective:**
   - Clustering: The goal of clustering is to group similar data points together, with no predefined target or association between clusters.
   - Association Rule Mining: The goal is to discover associations or patterns between items in a dataset, typically in the form of "if X, then Y" rules.

2. **Output:**
   - Clustering: The output is a set of clusters, where data points within a cluster are similar to each other.
   - Association Rule Mining: The output is a set of association rules that describe relationships between items or attributes.

3. **Algorithms:**
   - Clustering: Clustering algorithms include K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, and more. These algorithms partition or group data points based on similarity.
   - Association Rule Mining: Algorithms like Apriori and FP-growth are used to discover association rules within transactional or itemset data.

4. **Data Type:**
   - Clustering: Clustering is typically applied to numerical or multidimensional data, where similarity or distance metrics are used.
   - Association Rule Mining: Association rule mining is often applied to transactional data or data that involves categorical items or attributes.

5. **Usage:**
   - Clustering is used for tasks such as customer segmentation, image segmentation, and anomaly detection.
   - Association rule mining is used for tasks like market basket analysis in retail, recommendation systems, and finding co-occurring events in datasets.

In association rule mining, algorithms are used to efficiently identify frequent itemsets and generate rules based on support and confidence measures. These algorithms help automate the process of finding interesting associations within large datasets.

So, to answer your question, association rule mining does involve specific algorithms like Apriori and FP-growth to discover meaningful patterns within your data. These algorithms are essential for efficiently mining association rules from transactional or itemset data. You cannot perform association rule mining without using an algorithm to extract the rules from the data.
