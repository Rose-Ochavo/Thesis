The choice between labeling your research as "Data Mining" or "Machine Learning" in your research title depends on the emphasis and perspective you want to convey in your thesis. Both terms can be appropriate, but they may convey slightly different aspects of your research. Here's a breakdown of what each choice might imply:

1. **"Consumer Buying Behavior of Motorcycle Parts and Accessories Using Data Mining":**
   - If you use "Data Mining" in your title, it suggests that your primary focus is on the process of extracting patterns, associations, and insights from your dataset related to consumer buying behavior. This title emphasizes the use of data mining techniques such as association rule mining and clustering.
   - This choice implies that your primary goal is knowledge discovery and insight generation from your data.

2. **"Consumer Buying Behavior of Motorcycle Parts and Accessories Using Machine Learning":**
   - If you use "Machine Learning" in your title, it may imply a slightly different perspective. It suggests that while data mining techniques are part of your methodology, the main emphasis is on using machine learning models to predict or analyze consumer buying behavior.
   - This choice may imply a more predictive or modeling-oriented approach, where you use machine learning algorithms to make predictions or classifications related to consumer behavior.

Ultimately, the choice between these two terms should align with the primary objective and methodology of your research. If your primary goal is to use data mining techniques like association rule mining and clustering to uncover patterns and insights in consumer buying behavior, the "Data Mining" label is appropriate. If you plan to use machine learning models as a central component of your analysis, the "Machine Learning" label might be more suitable.

Consider your research's main focus and how you want to position it within the broader context of data analysis and knowledge discovery when making your decision. Additionally, you can discuss this choice with your advisor or committee to ensure it accurately reflects the content and objectives of your research.
