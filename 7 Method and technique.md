The terms "method" and "technique" are related and often used interchangeably in many contexts, but they can have slightly different nuances depending on the field or context in which they are used. Here's a general distinction:

1. Method:
   - A method refers to a systematic and organized way or procedure for accomplishing a particular task, solving a problem, or achieving a goal. It often involves a series of steps or a structured approach.
   - Methods are broader in scope and can encompass various techniques or approaches within them.
   - Methods are often associated with a specific discipline, domain, or area of expertise. For example, scientific methods, research methods, teaching methods, etc.

2. Technique:
   - A technique is a specific, often specialized, skill or method used to perform a particular task or achieve a specific outcome. It is a more focused and practical application within a broader method.
   - Techniques are often used within methods to execute specific tasks or actions efficiently.
   - Techniques can be more context-specific and may not always be applicable outside of the specific context for which they were developed.

In practice, people sometimes use these terms interchangeably, and the usage can vary depending on the field and context. However, it's important to recognize that there is a distinction between the two, with "method" typically referring to a broader approach or framework, and "technique" referring to a specific skill or method used within that framework.
